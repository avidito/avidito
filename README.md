Hi, I'm **Leo**, your friendly programmer :smile:

My other names are Avidito, Catfish Coder, or LeleWarrior :sunglasses:

I'm deeply in love with programming, although I'm not top tier coder. I really love to learn many things around IT and programming, especially in:
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: Data Solution
- :globe_with_meridians: System Design
- :cloud: Cloud Architect

This repo will be my **playground** for trying, understanding, and sharing about many things in IT. Feel free to contact me for discussion or project ideas!

So, let's fin up and happy coding! :fish: :grin:
